Getting Started
---------------

There are two ways of getting the app up and running for development. Using `Vagrant`_ (*The Better Way*) or installing everything manually (*The Adventurous Way*). The recommened method is to use Vagrant as it closely replicates the production environment.

The Better Way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to get the app running is to run `Vagrant`_. You can follow these steps to get the app running:

1. Install `Vagrant`_ of your preferred platform.
2. Install `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ or other `providers <http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/index.html>`_ supported by Vagrant.
3. Run ``vagrant up`` and read `Getting Started <http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html>`_ while waiting.
4. Run ``vagrant ssh`` to SSH into the development machine.

Once the development box is up and running, you may now run the server::

    $ vagrant ssh
    $ cd /vagrant
    $ pserve development.ini

Now you're done! You can now proceed to the Management Scripts section below.

The Adventurous Way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't really want to use Vagrant, you can also install everything using your preferred methods:

1. `Python 3.5 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
2. `PostgreSQL 9.5 <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_.
3. `Redis 3.0 <http://redis.io/>`_.
4. `Memcached 1.4 <http://www.memcached.org/>`_.
5. `Node.js 6.2 <http://nodejs.org/>`_ with `Yarn`_.

After the package above are up and running, you may now setup the application::

    $ cp examples/development.ini.sample development.ini
    $ cp examples/alembic.ini.sample alembic.ini
    $ python3.5 setup.py develop
    $ alembic upgrade head
    $ pserve development.ini

And you're done! You can now proceed to the Management Scripts section below.

Assets
------

The application doesn't come with assets compiled by default and are done externally via `Gulp`_ and `Typings`_. To compile assets, make sure Yarn packages are up-to-date and run ``typings`` and ``gulp`` accordingly::

    $ yarn
    $ yarn run typings install
    $ yarn run gulp

Once these commands are run, assets will be compiled to ``fanboi2/static`` in which you should point the web server to it. You should do this on every deploy.

Management Scripts
------------------

After you've setup the environment, the first thing you want to do is to create a new board::

    $ fb2_board_create development.ini --title Lounge --slug lounge
    $ fb2_board_create development.ini --title Demo --slug demo

Above commands will create a board named "Lounge" and "Demo" at ``/lounge`` and ``/demo`` respectively. Now if you want to update something such as description, you can now do::

    $ fb2_board_update development.ini -s lounge -f description

Slug is used here to identify which board to edit. All database fields in board are editable this way. Some field, such as ``settings`` must be a **valid JSON**. Both commands also accepts ``--help`` which will display some available options. Apart from the above two scripts, there are many other commands you might be interested in, such as:

1. ``pserve development.ini`` to run the development server with `Waitress <http://waitress.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
2. ``pshell development.ini`` to get into Python console with the app loaded.
3. ``fb2_celery development.ini worker`` to start a `Celery <http://www.celeryproject.org/>`_ worker.
4. ``alembic upgrade head`` to update the database to latest version with `Alembic <http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

Celery worker is required to be run if you want to enable posting features.

Contributing
------------

Please make sure that test coverage is 100% and everything passed. It's also a good idea to open a bug ticket for feature you want to implement before starting. We have development IRC channel at `irc.fanboi.ch#fanboi <irc://irc.fanboi.ch/#fanboi>`_. Although if you want to submit patch anonymously you can also create git patch and post it to `support board <https://fanboi.ch/meta/>`_ as well.

After you have done, simply open a pull request against **master** branch.
